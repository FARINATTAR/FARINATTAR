Same about section as my linkedin.. i was too lazy to write a new one 😂

hi, i’m farin 👋  

i like figuring out how things work behind the scenes  
(often after breaking them once or twice).

i learn by experimenting, googling a lot,  
and wondering why something worked yesterday but not today.

when i’m not coding, i’m usually reading, sketching,  
or adding another old coin to my small collection.

still learning, still exploring, and trying to get better  
without overthinking it
